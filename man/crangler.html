<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>crangler - C source transformation</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>crangler [-?] [-h] [--help]</strong></p>
<p><strong>crangler</strong><em> file.json</em></p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>crangler</strong> is a command-line utility that makes changes to a preprocessed C file that are prescribed in a JSON configuration file.</p>
<p>The supported transformations are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Add a contract (pre/post/assigns) to a named C function.</p>
<p>Add a loop contract to a loop identified by the name of the function containing the loop and a loop number.</p>
<p>Remove the <strong>static</strong> storage classifier from a function or a variable.</p>
<p>Replace a function call by a call to a stub.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The resulting source file is written to standard output or to a file specified in the JSON configuration.</p>
<h1>EXAMPLE</h1>
<p>The following JSON configuration file makes <strong>crangler</strong> preprocess <em>remove_static1.c</em>. While processing this file to produce a preprocessed result, no non-standard include paths or defines reqired. Transformations configured here are removing the <strong>static</strong> storage classifier from all functions matching the regular expression <strong>foobar[12]</strong>, and replacing calls to <em>bar</em> by calls to a function called <em>bar_stub</em>. No objects are listed that require transformation. The result is written to standard output.</p>
